## Project Overview

This project consists of three parts:
- **Part 1**: Object detection on shelf images using OpenCV and YOLO.
- **Part 2**: A Flask-based REST API for CRUD operations on product data.
- **Part 3**: Simulation of augmented reality effects using OpenCV to overlay text and animations on images.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **pip**: Python package installer

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: If `requirements.txt` isnâ€™t available, you can manually install the libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python torch torchvision flask setuptools
   ```

## Running the Code

### Part 1: Image Processing and Machine Learning

1. **Set the Image Path**: Open `part1.py` and specify the path to the image you want to process.
   ```python
   image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Replace with your actual image path
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python part1.py
   ```

3. **Output**: Processed images with bounding boxes will be saved in the default output directory.

### Part 2: Backend and API Development

1. **Start the Flask API**: 
   ```bash
   python part2.py
   ```

2. **Access the API**: You can test API endpoints (CRUD operations) using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/).

   Example `curl` command to add a product:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Product1", "price": 100}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/product
   ```

### Part 3: Data Handling and Augmented Reality Integration

1. **Set the Image Path**: Open `part3.py` and specify the path to the image you want to process with AR effects.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python part3.py
   ```

3. **Output**: Processed images with AR overlays and animations will be saved in the specified directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'**:
  - Install `setuptools` by running:
    ```bash
    pip install setuptools
    ```

- **Issues with Image Paths**:
  - Ensure the image paths in `part1.py` and `part3.py` are correct and point to existing images.
