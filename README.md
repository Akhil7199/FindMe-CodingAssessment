Project Overview
This project consists of three parts:

Part 1: Object detection on shelf images using OpenCV and YOLO.
Part 2: A Flask-based REST API for CRUD operations on product data.
Part 3: Simulation of augmented reality effects using OpenCV to overlay text and animations on images.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher
pip: Python package installer
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Install required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt isnâ€™t available, you can manually install the libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python torch torchvision flask setuptools
Running the Code
Part 1: Image Processing and Machine Learning
Set the Image Path: Open part1.py and specify the path to the image you want to process.

python
Copy code
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Replace with your actual image path
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python part1.py
Output: Processed images with bounding boxes will be saved in the default output directory.

Part 2: Backend and API Development
Start the Flask API:

bash
Copy code
python part2.py
Access the API: You can test API endpoints (CRUD operations) using tools like Postman or curl.

Example curl command to add a product:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Product1", "price": 100}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/product
Part 3: Data Handling and Augmented Reality Integration
Set the Image Path: Open part3.py and specify the path to the image you want to process with AR effects.

Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python part3.py
Output: Processed images with AR overlays and animations will be saved in the specified directory.

Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources':

Install setuptools by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install setuptools
Issues with Image Paths:

Ensure the image paths in part1.py and part3.py are correct and point to existing images.
